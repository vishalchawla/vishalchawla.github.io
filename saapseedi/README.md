=========================================

Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic. It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares. A number of ladders and snakes are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start to the finish, helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively. I've developed this snakes and ladders game in javascript using html5 canvas so that it can be played online on web browsers
